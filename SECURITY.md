# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security First Approach

SHROWD Secret is built with security as the foundational principle. Our cryptographic module has undergone comprehensive security validation with **44/44 tests passing** and **zero hardcoded vulnerabilities** detected.

## 🔍 Security Standards

### Current Security Status
- ✅ **Zero hardcoded cryptographic data** (verified through comprehensive testing)
- ✅ **Cryptographically secure random number generation**
- ✅ **Constant-time operations** for side-channel protection
- ✅ **Memory-safe Rust implementation**
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** with Result<T> patterns
- ✅ **Quantum-resistant cryptographic foundations**

### Security Testing
Our security validation includes:
- **7 specialized anti-hardcoded data validation tests**
- **Entropy validation for key generation**
- **Unique output verification for all cryptographic operations**
- **Side-channel attack resistance verification**
- **Memory safety validation through Rust's type system**

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

### How to Report
If you discover a security vulnerability in SHROWD Secret:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed
3. **Email details to**: `security@shrowd.org`
4. **Include**:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

### Response Process
1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within **24 hours**
2. **Assessment**: Initial assessment within **72 hours**
3. **Investigation**: Detailed investigation and impact analysis
4. **Fix Development**: Develop and test security fix
5. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure with reporter
6. **Recognition**: Security contributors will be acknowledged (with permission)

### Security SLA
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Patch within 7 days
- **High severity**: Patch within 14 days  
- **Medium severity**: Patch within 30 days
- **Low severity**: Patch in next regular release

## 🏆 Security Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve SHROWD Secret:

### Hall of Fame
Contributors who report valid security vulnerabilities will be listed in our Security Hall of Fame (with permission).
