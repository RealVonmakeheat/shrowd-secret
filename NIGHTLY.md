## 🚀 About Nightly Branch

Inspired by **Arch Linux's bleeding-edge philosophy**, the `nightly` branch is where we push the boundaries of cryptographic performance and experiment with cutting-edge features. This is for developers who:

- 🦉 **Code at night** and love experimental features
- ⚡ **Want the latest optimizations** before they hit stable
- 🔬 **Enjoy testing** bleeding-edge cryptographic implementations
- 🛠️ **Contribute actively** to high-performance crypto development

## ⚠️ Nightly vs Stable

| Branch | Purpose | Stability | Performance | Who Should Use |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **`master`** | Production-ready | ✅ **Stable** | High (2.6M+ ops/sec) | Production applications |
| **`nightly`** | Experimental | ⚠️ **Bleeding Edge** | Higher (targeting 5M+ ops/sec) | Developers, researchers, enthusiasts |

## 🔥 Nightly Features (Experimental)

### **Currently in Development:**
- 🚀 **SIMD Optimizations**: Vectorized Blake3 implementations
- ⚡ **Zero-Copy Operations**: Eliminate memory allocations
- 🔧 **Custom Allocators**: Memory pool optimizations
- 🧪 **Quantum-Resistant Algorithms**: Post-quantum cryptography experiments
- 📊 **Advanced Benchmarking**: Micro-benchmark suite
- 🔍 **Profiling Integration**: Built-in performance analysis

### **Target Performance Goals:**
```
🎯 NIGHTLY TARGETS (vs Current Stable):
Key Generation:     5M+ ops/sec (vs 2.6M current)
Digital Signing:    8M+ ops/sec (vs 2.4M current)  
Verification:       500M+ ops/sec (vs 142M current)
Hash Operations:    20M+ ops/sec (vs 9.3M current)
Memory Usage:       <500KB (vs <1MB current)
```

## 🛠️ Nightly Installation

### **From Git (Recommended for Night Owls)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RealVonmakeheat/shrowd-secret.git
cd shrowd-secret
git checkout nightly
cargo build --release --all-features
```

### **Testing Nightly Features**
```bash
# Run all tests including experimental ones
cargo test --all-features

# Run performance benchmarks
cargo test --test comprehensive_crypto_tests --release -- --nocapture

# Run nightly-specific stress tests
cargo test --test nightly_stress_tests --release -- --nocapture
```

## 🌙 Contributing to Nightly

### **Perfect for Night Coding Sessions:**

**🔥 High-Impact Areas:**

## 🧪 Experimental Features

### **Feature Flags (Nightly Only)**
```toml
[features]
default = ["std"]
std = []
nightly = ["simd", "zero-copy", "custom-alloc"]
simd = []                    # SIMD vectorization
zero-copy = []              # Zero-allocation operations  
custom-alloc = []           # Custom memory allocators
quantum-resistant = []       # Post-quantum experiments
profiling = []              # Built-in performance profiling
```

### **Usage Example (Nightly Features)**
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "nightly")]
use shrowd_secret::nightly::{SIMDCryptoProvider, ZeroCopyOperations};

#[cfg(feature = "nightly")]
fn experimental_crypto() -> Result<(), CryptoError> {
    let provider = SIMDCryptoProvider::new();
    let (private_key, public_key) = provider.generate_keypair_simd();
    
    // Zero-copy signing (experimental)
    let signature = provider.sign_zero_copy(&private_key, b"message")?;
    
    // SIMD-optimized verification
    assert!(provider.verify_simd(&public_key, b"message", &signature));
    Ok(())
}
```
